## Information about variables 

- $\textbf{Fuel Type}$ :- 
- Transportation Fuel means any fuel used or intended for use as a motor vehicle fuel .
- In our data , there are 2 types of Fuel - Gasoline and Diesel . Fuel type is denoted as 1 if fuel type is gasoline and it is denoted as 2 if fuel type is diesel .

- $\textbf{Fuel Cost}$ :-
- Fuel cost means the cost of fuel consumed for the mode used for  transportation of milk . It is measured in the unit cents/mi .

##

- $\textbf{Repair Cost}$ :- Repair costs for transportation refer to the expenses incurred in repairing or maintaining vehicles used for transportation purposes. It is also measured in unit cents/mi .

- $\textbf{capital Cost}$ :- Costs applying to the physical assets of transportation, mainly infrastructures, terminals, and vehicles. It is also measured in unit cents/mi.

## Shapiro Wilk Test

- Assumption :- Here ,   $X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n}$ are random sample from a population .

- Null Hypothesis :- $X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n}$ are i.i.d $N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ for some $\mu,\sigma^2$ 

- Test statistic :-  W = $\frac{(\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_{i}X_{(i)})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i} - \bar{X})^2}$ where , a = $\frac{m^TV}{\sqrt{m^TV^{-1}V^{-1}m}}$ with m and V the mean vector and variance -covariance matrix of $(Z_{(1)},....,Z_{(n)})^T, Z_i$ follows i.i.d. $N(0,1)$

- Rejection criteria :-  Reject the null hypothesis for large values of the test statistic

## Shapiro Wilk Test

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/ss1.png')
```

- Only, Normality of repair cost is accepted at 0.05 level of significance

## MULTIVARIATE NORMALITY 

- Here we use mvn function (MVN package ) in R 

- It gives multivariate normality test using Henze Zirkler and 
also a univarite normality test using Anderson Darling

## Anderson Darling  

- Assumption :- Here,  $X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n}$ are random sample from a population 

- Null Hypothesis :- The data comes from a specified distrubutions  

- Alternate Hypothesis :- The data does not come from the specified distributions

## Anderson Darling

- Test statistic :-  AD = $-n-\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i-1)[lnF(X_{i}) + ln(1-F(X_{n-i+1}))$ 

where , n = the sample size ; F(X) = the cdf of the specified distributions ,i = the i th sample , calculated when the data is sorted in ascending order . 

- Decision :- Then , find the p value of the test statistic and if p value are less , we reject the null hypothesis 



## Henze Zirkler

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/klm.jpg')
``` 

## mvn

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/ss2.png')
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/ss3.png')
``` 

- Here, Normailty of repair cost is accepted at 0.05 level of significance

## Transformation of variable

$y = ((x+1)^{\lambda}-1)/\lambda$ if $\lambda \neq0$

  $=log(x+1)$ o.w.  
  
- Find the $\lambda$ for which the log-likelihood is maximized

- log-likelihood :-

$-(n/2)(log(2\pi)+log(\hat{\sigma}^{2}))-((sum((y-\hat{\mu}^2))/(2\hat{\sigma}^{2})))$

$+(\lambda-1)\sum(sign(x_i)log(mod(x_i)+1))$

## Transformation

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/ss4.png')
``` 

- Select $\lambda$ as -0.4 for fuel cost

## Transformation

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/ss5.png')
``` 

- Select $\lambda$ as 0.1 for capital cost

## QQPLOT and HISTOGRAM after Transformation

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/fc_trns_dp_qqp.png')
``` 

## QQPLOT and HISTOGRAM after Transformation

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/cc_trns_dp_qqp.png')
```

## Repair cost

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/rc_trns_dp_qqp.png')
``` 

##
 
- If we apply transformation in repair cost, then also it remains more or less bimodal in nature

- Since at first test for normality accepts for it so that we do not transform it.

## MVN after Transformation

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/ss6.png')
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/ss7.png')
```

- Univariate as well as Multivariate normality accepts


## Test fot Homogeneity

- Since normality accepts so we are looking for homogeneity of variance covariance
matrix of 2 data set.

- We use BoxM test for testing

- Box-M Test

- Assumption :- $X_{i}(n_{i}*p)$ are $NDM_{p}(\mu_{i},\Sigma_{i})$ i = 1(1)k

- Null Hypothesis :- all variance-covariance matrices are equal 

- Alternate Hypothesis :- variance-covariance matrices are not equal

## Box-M Test

- Test statistic :- M = $\gamma[\sum_{i=1}^{k}(n_{i}-1)log|S_{u_{i}}^{-1}S_{u}|]$ 
where , $S_{u}$ = $\frac{nS}{n-k}$ 
$S_{u_{i}}$ = $\frac{n_{i}S_{i}}{n_{i}-1}$
$\gamma$ = 1 - $\frac{2p^2+3p-1}{6(p+1)(k-1)}[\sum_{i=1}^{k} (\frac{1}{n_{i}-1}-\frac{1}{n-k})]$

- Asymptotic distribution(under $H_{0}$ : Chi-square with df = $\frac{1}{2}p(p+1)(k-1)$

- Decision :- Then , find the p value of the test statistic and if p value are less,we reject the null hypothesis.

## Box-M Test

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/ss8.png')
```

- Accept $H_{0}: \Sigma_{1} = \Sigma_{2}$ at 0.05 level of significance.

## Manova

- Since homogeneity of variance covariance matrix accepted so we are going for MANOVA

- In general in manova, we test $H_{0}: \mu_{1}= \mu_{2}=....=\mu_{k}$ vs $H1: \mu_{i} \neq \mu_{j}$ for some i,j when the covariance matrix of the k populations are equal.

- Here, k = 2. Consider, Fuel type as a treatment having 2 level, Disel and Gasoline

- It can be shown that the LRT statistic for the above testing when we have two population is equivalent to two sample Hotelling $T^2$

##

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/ss9.png')
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/ss10.png')
```

## Hotelling's T square 

- Given $\Sigma_{1}=\Sigma_{2}$

- To test $H_{0}$: $\mu_{1}$=$\mu_{2}$ vs $H_{1}$: $\mu_{1}\neq\mu_{2}$

- Test Statistic : $D^{2}=(n_{1}n_{2}/n)(\bar{x_{1}}-\bar{x_{2}})'S_{u}^{-1}(\bar{x_{1}}-\bar{x_{2}})$
where $S_{u} =(n_{1}S_{1}+n_{2}S_{2})/(n-2)$ , $n=n_{1}+n_{2}$

- Under $H_{0}: D^{2}  follows  T^2(p,n-2)$

## Hotelling's T square 

 

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/ss11.png')
```

- From the testing ,we get the p-value $2.685e-07$. So, we reject $H_{0}$: $\mu_{1}$=$\mu_{2}$ at 0.05 level of significance

- So, there is a significant effect of Fuel type (Gasoline or disel) 


## ANOVA

- Now,we are interest for checking of treatment,fuel type with each of the variable individually

- At first we consider Fuel cost

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/manova1.png')
```

- Here, p-value is 0.09464.So we accept $H_{0}$ at 0.05 level of significance.So, there is no effect of fuel type in fuel cost

## ANOVA 

- Capital Cost

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/manova2.png')
```

- Here , P-value is $1.45e-07$.So we reject $H_{0}$ at 0.05 level of significance. So, there is a effect of fuel type in capital cost

## ANOVA 

- Repair Cost

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/manova3.png')
```

- Here , P-value is 0.03348.So we reject $H_{0}$ at 0.05 level of significance. So, there is a effect of fuel type in repair cost

- Confusion matrix

```{r , echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('T:/SEM 2/MULTIVARIATE_SWAGATANANDI/PROJECT WORK/Images/cm_log.jpg')

## Factor Analysis

- The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin (KMO) test is a statistical measure to determine how suited data is for factor analysis. The test measures sampling adequacy for each variable in the model and the complete model. The statistic is a measure of the proportion of variance among variables that might be common variance. The higher the proportion, the higher the KMO-value, the more suited the data is to factor analysis.

## Profile Analysis

## Report :

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

- In the light of the given data , it seems that the profiles are not parallel.

- Hence, needless to do the test for coincidence.


## Findings 

- There were few outliers in the data, but we continue to work with those as removing them may lead to information loss.

- The variable repair cost justifies to follow normal even if the histogram is not exactly symmetric. It will be a motive to find transformations to attain symmetricity during further analysis.

- On transformation of the remaining two variables , finally the transformed data in hand showed multivariate normality using Henze Zirkler test.

- On performing Box -M test , the two populations seemed to be homogenous in the light of the data.


##


- But on performing the test of equality of the means for the two populations , the tests gets rejected . This shows some justification for the test of parallel profiles , which shows that in the light of the given data , the two profiles are not parallel and hence not , coincident.

- Since , the two populations are homogenous , we wish to perform Linear Discriminant Analysis and the from there we observed that misclassification error is 0.18 which is same as in case of classification when done by Logistic Regression.

- The principal component analysis and factor analysis does not make sense being implemented in the data.
